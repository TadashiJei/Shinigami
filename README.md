# Shinigami: Your Pocket-Sized WiFi/Bluetooth Analysis Powerhouse

Shinigami is a suite of offensive and defensive tools for the ESP32, designed to analyze WiFi and Bluetooth networks. It provides a portable alternative to bulkier traffic capture equipment, offering frame capture, device enumeration, and frame transmission capabilities for post-analysis.

# Key Features

* Frame Capture: Capture and store wireless packets for later examination, revealing valuable insights into network activity and device interactions.
* Device Enumeration: Identify and list nearby WiFi and Bluetooth devices, giving you a comprehensive overview of the wireless environment.
* Frame Transmission: Simulate specific scenarios or explore device behavior by transmitting controlled frames onto the network.

# Applications

Shinigami can be a valuable tool for various purposes, including:

* Network Security Assessments (With Proper Authorization): Analyze network traffic for vulnerabilities during penetration testing to strengthen your network's defenses.
* Wireless Network Troubleshooting: Diagnose WiFi and Bluetooth connection issues by examining frame exchanges, pinpointing interference, signal strength problems, or configuration errors.
* Wireless Research and Development: Monitor and analyze data flow to optimize your wireless application development efforts.

# Ethical Considerations

Shinigami's capabilities can be misused. Always prioritize ethical practices and legal compliance.

* Obtain Permission: Only capture traffic on networks you have explicit authorization to access.
* Respect Privacy: Avoid eavesdropping on private communications and use Shinigami for authorized testing purposes only.
* Understand Local Laws: Wireless analysis tools might be subject to regulations in your region. Familiarize yourself with applicable laws before using Shinigami.
